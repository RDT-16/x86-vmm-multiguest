# x86-vmm-multiguest

This project builds a Virtual Machine Monitor (VMM) capable of running multiple guest operating systems—such as multiple instances of JOS—using x86 VM support. It focuses on hypervisor-level management, isolation, and resource allocation in a virtualized environment.

## 🔍 Introduction

![Intro](doc/fig(a).png)

Virtual Machine Monitors (VMMs), or hypervisors, allow multiple operating systems to share a single hardware platform. This project focuses on a custom VMM that runs multiple x86-based guest operating systems like JOS.

---

## ❗ Problem Statement

![Problem Statement](doc/fig(b).png)

Traditional virtualization platforms face challenges in performance, isolation, and compatibility. This project aims to create a lightweight yet effective VMM that overcomes these challenges on the x86 architecture.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

![Objectives](doc/fig(c).png)

- Develop a VMM using x86 hardware virtualization support.
- Enable concurrent execution of multiple guest OSes.
- Maintain strong isolation and resource efficiency.
- Ensure extensibility for real-world use cases.

---

## 🛠️ Methodology

![Methodology](doc/fig(d).png)

- Use hardware features like Intel VT-x for virtualization.
- Implement guest VM lifecycle management (start, stop, snapshot).
- Use VMCS (Virtual Machine Control Structure) for managing VM state.

## ⚙️ Implementation Details

![VMM Lifecycle](doc/fig(f)_fig(g).png)

- Support for multiple JOS instances.
- Context switching between guest VMs using VMExit and VMEntry.
- Trap handling and emulation for privileged instructions.

---

## 📊 Performance Optimization

![Optimization](doc/fig(h).png)

- Profile critical code paths using `perf`.
- Reduce VMExit frequency using paravirtualization strategies.
- Efficient memory management and CPU scheduling.

---

## 🔒 Security Assessment

![Security](doc/fig(i).png)

- Analyze isolation boundaries using fuzzing and static analysis.
- Implement minimal trusted computing base.
- Mitigate side-channel vulnerabilities (e.g., Spectre/Meltdown).

---

## 🚀 Deployment & Evaluation

![Deployment](doc/fig(j)_fig(k).png)

- Deployed in a multi-core system.
- Benchmarked with multiple guest workloads.
- Evaluated CPU, memory, and I/O overheads.

---

## 🔮 Future Scope

The VMM can evolve to support:

- Hardware accelerators and cryptographic co-processors.
- Edge computing scenarios with real-time constraints.
- Container-VMM hybrid platforms.
- Advanced security features like real-time threat detection.
